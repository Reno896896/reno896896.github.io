		This is my first journal entry. So far, I've add the background drawing board image(done last class), and included a basketball image as the link for my journal, which I'm writing in right now. I had a lab which helped me a lot in finding out how to link and add images earlier this week as well. My goals for this class are to finish touching up the styling for the writing in my journal. I already switched the font, and am working on the background coloring and centering of the actual writing.

		Today is my second journal entry. I haven't been writing enough and one of my goals is to update this journal once a week. Since my last entry, I submitted my person card, which has obviously been done for a while, and pushed my website though github. I now need to work on this, my journal, and spend a lot of time designing my website. Recently, this past week, I collaborated with Priester on an animation, which we didn't finish. Nontheless, it was supposed to be Nemo swimming away from a shark. I also knew all of the things that were on the assignment, and how to do them, besides positioning and aligning things around the page. I labbed with Molly and now have a better understanding of this. That's all for this entry, see you next time!<br><br>

		This class we worked on functions. I used the clicking function to then spawn funny pictures of my friends, Nick who's in this class and Sami. I was out all week last week except for our class on Monday because I was sick, so I missed our Thursday class. However, I feel all caught up, and think I'm going to start a weekly lab with Molly. Until next time!<br><br>
Nov. 8th:<br>
		During today's class, we kind of had a checkpoint in that we self evaluated our websites and tried to think of what we need to make our journals "doper." One of the necessites is actually having four journal entries, so this journal entry in itself is solving this. I'm trying to get more projects on my website, first of course I need a project page as well. Otherwise I feel like I'm in a good place. Tootaloo until next time!<br><br>
Nov. 29th<br>
		Today is our first class since Thanksgiving Break, and we are currently making sure that we have qualifying websites. The first qualification for today was to have 5 journal entries, so by writing today, I check that off the list. My about me and project pages are pretty much non-existent, but I'm working on them and made significant additions to my home page this week. Until next time!<br><br>
Mar. 1st<br>
		Alright so I know, I took quite a significant hiatus from journal writing, but on the contrary, although when I last wrote my journal I had a less detailed and very basic website, since the last entry, my website has truly come to fruition. I have made many more projects, built the non-existent about me page that I mentioned in the previous entry, and learned so much about coding. This entry will be a recap of everything I've done. First of all, I made my how it works presentation on the tiktok foryoupage, and embedded it on my projects page. In the presentation, I depicted the tiktok algorithim, and how the three main factors, user interaction, video info, and device and account setting construct what users will view on their fyp. This was done in December, before break. Since January,I've made three projects. I made an Eli Manning moving head, which is a function that follows your mouse around the screen and resets when the page is reloaded. For the data representation project, instead of representing data, I made an ASMR randomizer, by embedding youtube ASMR videos onto my website and creating two lists with the same variable, having the lists corresponding to one another and making a video pop up. Finally, the other game I made tracks, in the console log, the x and y coordinates of a click which is done using an event listener. Ok, I know that was super long, but I needed to compensate for like three missed entries. See you next time!<br><br>
Mar. 7th<br>
		We're back after a week. Again, I'm sorry for the prolonged break from entries, but I'm committing to writing here more consistently. This week, we are finalizing our digital appreciation cards. I made mine for Christina, and will show her later on in the week. It has a keydance that makes a div with a photo of us zoom above and below a message in Spanish thanking her for everything she does for me. I hope she likes it! That's all for today, see you next week?<br><br>
March. 10th<br>
		Wow, I'm staying consistent. It hasn't even been a whole half week since the last time I wrote an entry. Today's topic of discussion is going to be my questions that I want to know about coding. Most of them will be derived from the worksheet we did last week. <br> They are:<br>1. How do you use getelement correctly?<br>2. How many different types of event listeners are there?<br>3. What is a conditional statement in coding?<br>4. How do you do the hover color changing function?<br>5. Can you make your own unique functions that do animations never invented before?<br> That's all! Until next time! <br><br>
March. 28th<br>
		My Questions for my future potential project:
		Why does snapchat have a facetime and call feature when the iPhone already has one for each?
		How are filters made and can anyone make a filter?<br><br>
April. 11th<br>
		This week is the final week where we finished our corona virus project. Although my individual work is unrelated to covid-19, the project is called that because the project originally involved covid-19 spike proteins being clicked on, making a sound, and then dissappearing. As per Molly's request, I am going to give a general explanation of how this project works. Essentially, we have a div creator, which produces divs at a certain rate which is modified at the bottom of the function. Simultaneously, there is a function that is changing the position at random of those divs once created, and similar to the the div creator, the speed at which the position of the divs moves at can be changed. Additionally, there is a class for these divs, and I defined the class background as Nicolas Claxton, one of my favorite basketball players on my favorite team, the Brooklyn Nets. There is another function that runs an is listening or waiting for clicks and a sound that plays in this function when a div in the class is clicked. Once clicked, the div in the class loses all its characteristics, and becomes invisible because it has no characteristics, making it seem as it has appeared. Until next time!
