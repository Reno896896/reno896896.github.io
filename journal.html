Oct. 7th:
	

		This is my first journal entry. So far, I've add the background drawing board image(done last class), and included a basketball image as the link for my journal, which I'm writing in right now. I had a lab which helped me a lot in finding out how to link and add images earlier this week as well. My goals for this class are to finish touching up the styling for the writing in my journal. I already switched the font, and am working on the background coloring and centering of the actual writing.
