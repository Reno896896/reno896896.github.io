		This is my first journal entry. So far, I've add the background drawing board image(done last class), and included a basketball image as the link for my journal, which I'm writing in right now. I had a lab which helped me a lot in finding out how to link and add images earlier this week as well. My goals for this class are to finish touching up the styling for the writing in my journal. I already switched the font, and am working on the background coloring and centering of the actual writing.

		Today is my second journal entry. I haven't been writing enough and one of my goals is to update this journal once a week. Since my last entry, I submitted my person card, which has obviously been done for a while, and pushed my website though github. I now need to work on this, my journal, and spend a lot of time designing my website. Recently, this past week, I collaborated with Priester on an animation, which we didn't finish. Nontheless, it was supposed to be Nemo swimming away from a shark. I also knew all of the things that were on the assignment, and how to do them, besides positioning and aligning things around the page. I labbed with Molly and now have a better understanding of this. That's all for this entry, see you next time!<br><br>

		This class we worked on functions. I used the clicking function to then spawn funny pictures of my friends, Nick who's in this class and Sami. I was out all week last week except for our class on Monday because I was sick, so I missed our Thursday class. However, I feel all caught up, and think I'm going to start a weekly lab with Molly. Until next time!<br><br>
Nov. 8th:<br>
		During today's class, we kind of had a checkpoint in that we self evaluated our websites and tried to think of what we need to make our journals "doper." One of the necessites is actually having four journal entries, so this journal entry in itself is solving this. I'm trying to get more projects on my website, first of course I need a project page as well. Otherwise I feel like I'm in a good place. Tootaloo until next time!<br><br>
Nov. 29th<br>
		Today is our first class since Thanksgiving Break, and we are currently making sure that we have qualifying websites. The first qualification for today was to have 5 journal entries, so by writing today, I check that off the list. My about me and project pages are pretty much non-existent, but I'm working on them and made significant additions to my home page this week. Until next time!<br><br>
